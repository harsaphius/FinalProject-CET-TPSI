<h2>Web Application for Management of Cinel's Office üè¢ </h2>

This project aimed to develop a set of applications in ASP.NET Web and Xamarim Forms that integrated data from a SQL Server database and 
allowed effective management of the main activities of the CINEL's office.
In the first instance, a Project Charter was developed which outlined the general and specific objectives to be achieved in 
the development of this project, the functionalities to be integrated as well as the resources and tools to be used.
The first stage of development was the gathering of requirements and the preparation of structural diagrams, notably the 
Use Case Diagram. 
Next, planning began, with the definition of appropriate work blocks using the Notion¬Æ tool, building a map of tasks organized 
chronologically and with appropriate time spaces for each work block.
This phase was followed by the creation of the database in SQL Server, including all tables and relationships essential to the 
proper functioning of the application, followed by the development phase of the Web application in ASP.NET and Mobile 
application in Xamarim Forms.
